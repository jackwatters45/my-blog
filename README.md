# Jack Watters' Portfolio

Welcome to my personal website. My name is Jack, I'm a software developer with a passion for creating user-friendly productivity software.

Letâ€™s connect! I'm always open to discussing potential collaborations, knowledge exchange, or simply chatting about the latest trends in web development, the intrigue of world travel, or the excitement of hockey (no Canucks fans):
