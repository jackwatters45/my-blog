Dear Hiring Team,

I am interested in the Software Development Engineer - Dev Platform role at Workday. With extensive experience in software engineering, I thrive in environments that challenge me to push the boundaries of what's possible in technology. My background encompasses both front-end and back-end development, allowing me to create full-stack solutions that are efficient, scalable, and user-friendly.

At Freestyle Languages, I led a significant overhaul of our Learning Management System (LMS) and website, leveraging my skills in Java and related technologies to optimize performance and enhance user experience. This involved collaborating with cross-functional teams to integrate new features and functionalities, much like what is required at Workday. Additionally, I automated AI-powered customer service processes at Insurance BCX, which resulted in a 60% improvement in response rates and substantial time savings. My expertise in managing and developing distributed systems will allow me to effectively address the challenges associated with scaling and maintaining the OMS Developer Platform.

Workday's commitment to a collaborative, employee-centric culture resonates deeply with me. I am particularly drawn to your mission of fostering both personal and professional growth within a supportive environment. I am eager to contribute to Workday's next stage of growth by developing robust, low-latency software systems and by continuously seeking ways to improve team efficiency and code quality.

Thank you for considering my application. I would love to discuss how my background and skills align with the needs of your team.

Cheers,

John (Jack) Watters
